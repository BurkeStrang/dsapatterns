// You are visiting a farm to collect fruits.
// The farm has a single row of fruit trees.
// You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
//
// You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree.
// The farm has following restrictions:
//
// Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
// You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e.,
// you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: arr=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
// Example 2:
//
// Input: arr = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
// Constraints:
//
// 1 <= arr.length <=
// 0 <= arr[i] < arr.length
