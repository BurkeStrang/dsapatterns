// Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
// You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
//
// The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
// and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
//
// Examples
// Example 1
// Input: arr = [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
// Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
// Explanation:
// All 0s are moved to the front, 1s in the middle, and 2s at the end.
// The relative order within each group doesn't matter.
// Example 2
// Input: arr= [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
// Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
// Explanation:
// All 0s come first, followed by the 1, and then all 2s at the end.
// Sorting is done in-place without using extra space or counting.
// Constraints:
//
// n == arr.length
// 1 <= n <= 300
// arr[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
